# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This README is the index and quick-guide for OctoAcme's project management documents. It provides a short summary of our approach and direct links to each process guide in this docs/ folder so contributors and stakeholders can find the right guidance and artifacts quickly.

## Brief overview of OctoAcme project management processes

OctoAcme runs cross-functional work using a structured, iterative lifecycle: Initiation → Planning → Execution → Release → Retrospective & Continuous Improvement. Core principles are customer-first outcomes, iterative delivery, clear ownership (named PM and Product Lead), data-informed decisions, and psychological safety. Work is organized into small, testable increments with explicit acceptance criteria, tracked via a project board and CI-driven PR workflow. Risks are logged in a Risk Register and communicated via a regular cadence; retrospectives convert learnings into prioritized action items.
